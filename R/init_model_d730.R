## Define the MRSA model.

## Cumulative mortality rates based on Winpig 2019:
## From birth to weaning: 17.7
## From weaning to finishing: 2.0
## From finishing to slaughter 1.7
## ** Annual average removal rate for sows based on Engblom et al. 2007: 49.5 %. However, this is mostly taken into account with
## the removal of animals due to not getting pregnant/at time of weaning, therefore the rate needs to be adjusted.
## Total of 14.9 % of the removed sows were either euthanized or found dead which is ~7.4 % of the sows removed annually
## However this isn't implemented currently as it would be problematic to end up having piglets without a sow.

## Times spent in units:
## Birth to weaning ~33 d /  FIXME, currently timer for farrowing is 35 d because piglets are born too early
## Weaning to finishing 56 d
## Finishing to slaughter 92 d
## Daily mortality rates are calculated by using the explonential decay function N1 = Ne^(-xt)
## which transforms into x = -log(1-cumulative mortality probability)/time

## Daily mortality probabilities based on above:
## Birth to weaning: 0.006 (calculated based on 32 d)
## Weaning to finishing: 0.0004
## Finishing to slaughter: 0.0002

## Transitions between susceptible and carrier states:
## currently the betas are not reflecting any values found in literature
## problem of returning back to susceptible: only value of average carriage time?

## half-life for LA-MRSA is dust is 5 days based on Feld at al. 2018
## based on exponential decay function Nt = N(1/2)^(t/t1/2)
## -> 1/2 ^(1/5) -> 0.8705506

## duration of LA-MRSA carriage 17.4d (Broens 2012 "Quantification of transmission...")
## between_pen is the rate for between pen environmental load transmission, currently set a random value

## values and transition functions when only indirect transmission is enabled
